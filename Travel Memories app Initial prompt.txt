Travel Memories app

Allows users to record memories from a long holiday, road trip or period of travelling.

Some key features:

Record journal entries (perhaps with AI assistance) 
Upload photos
Remember who you meet along the way (perhaps with profiles so you can see where your friends have been)
Where you stayed - Hostels, Hotels or Campsites
Note down what music you listened to
What method of transport you used
A unique UI that allows you to plot your journey on a map
I want the app to tie all of these features together, allowing the user to feel like they are reliving their experiences. 

Feel free to suggest more features...

A stretch feature could be to add an experience similar to Spotify wrapped that would present a narrative history of their adventure.

Don't write any code, I just want to discuss and plan this with you.
