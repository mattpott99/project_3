# Coding Agent Prompt — M1: Trip Foundation & Navigation

## Role
You are a coding agent implementing **Milestone M1 — Trip Foundation & Navigation**
for a mobile-first Travel Memories app.

You must implement ONLY what is explicitly in scope.
Do not speculate about or prepare for future milestones.

---

## Goal
Implement the Trip foundation layer:
- Trip entity
- Trip library (home)
- Trip navigation & scoping

This milestone establishes the structural backbone for all future features.

---

## In Scope (Must Implement)

### Trip Entity
A Trip must have:
- **Unique name per user (duplicates NOT allowed)**
- Start date (required)
- End date (optional)
- Optional cover image
- Archived flag (soft delete)
- Creation timestamp

Trips are:
- User-owned
- Private
- Independent

---

### Trip Library (Home State)
The app must provide:
- A Trip Library as the default entry point
- Ability to:
  - Create a Trip
  - View all Trips
  - Open a Trip
  - Archive and restore a Trip

Requirements:
- Mobile-first UI
- Clear visual distinction between Trips
- Empty state handled gracefully

---

### Trip Scoping & Navigation
- Only **one Trip** can be active at a time
- Opening a Trip:
  - Sets it as the active scope
  - Ensures all future data belongs to it
- There must be a clear way to return to the Trip Library
- Archiving the active Trip must return the user to the Trip Library

---

## Explicitly Out of Scope (Do NOT Implement)

- Maps or location data
- Journal entries or photos
- People, music, transport, or accommodations
- AI features
- Sharing, exporting, or analytics
- Any UI or data for future milestones

Trips are containers only at this stage.

---

## Data & Ownership Rules

- Trip is the top-level container
- Archiving must not delete data
- Duplicate Trip names must be rejected with clear user feedback

---

## Error & Edge Case Handling

- Duplicate Trip names → block creation
- Empty Trip Library → valid state
- Trips with no content → valid
- App restart → Trips must persist

---

## Exit / Validation Criteria

You are done when:
- Multiple Trips can be created and persisted
- Duplicate Trip names are prevented
- One Trip can be opened at a time
- Active Trip state is clearly visible
- Archiving and restoring works correctly
- No assumptions are made about future features

---

## Required Output Report

When finished, report:
1. Scope implemented
2. Files added or changed
3. Validation steps performed
4. Confirmation that out-of-scope items were NOT implemented
